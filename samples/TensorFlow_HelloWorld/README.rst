TensorFlow_HelloWorld
=====================

The power of Machine Learning (ML) inside you microcontroller!
This sample is a remake of the standard `HelloWorld example <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world>`_ from TensorFlowLite for Arduino.
It demonstrated how a ML "model" can be used inside an ESP8266 mircocontroller with the help of Sming.

If you are not familiar with TensorFlow take a look at their `documentation <https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/get_started>`_.

Compilation
-----------
This sample can be compiled and run on a ESP8266 microcontroller or on the Host architecture.
In order to compile it for ESP8266 you must use `ESP Quick Toolchain <https://sming.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arch/esp8266/getting-started/eqt.html>`_.
The ESP Quick Toolchain is more feature-complete and allows the compilation to run without many modifications to the original library.
